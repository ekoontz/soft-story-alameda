# Soft Story Alameda

## What it is

This is an in-progress map of soft story buildings in the City of Alameda, kept up-to-date by pulling from Alameda's instance of the Accela API.

The current vision of this is as a standalone site that is linked out to from the City of Alameda's web site: they will have a static image of the map on their site with a big "click here to go to the map" or somesuch that takes users to this interactive web map.
